# Karthikeya-E-Cart
Karthikeya E-Cart is a simple front-end website I built in 2024 for fun, combining my interest in movies with web development. The site uses a Tollywood-inspired theme and showcases shirts and merchandise designed around popular actors. It’s fully built with HTML, CSS. This project reflects my creativity as a movie fan &amp; ability to design.
