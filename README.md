# Karthikeya-E-Cart
Karthikeya E-Cart is a simple front-end website I built in 2024 for fun, combining my interest in movies with web development. The site uses a Tollywood-inspired theme and showcases shirts and merchandise designed around popular actors. It’s fully built with HTML, CSS. This project reflects my creativity as a movie fan &amp; ability to design.

## Technologies Used
HTML5
CSS3

## Notes
Built in 2024 as a fun personal project inspired by my love for movies.
Focused mainly on design, colors, and a Tollywood vibe, not backend functionality.
Created to practice front-end skills, animations, layout structure, and product styling.
Demonstrates my ability to make a theme-based UI that looks clean and engaging.
Simple, beginner-friendly project but visually appealing and creatively designed.
